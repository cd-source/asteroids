## Controls

| Fire | Space |
| Hyperspace | Tab (teleport to safety — requires charges) |

## How to Play

Destroy all asteroids to advance to the next level. Large asteroids split into medium, medium into small. You start with 3 lives — colliding with an asteroid costs one.

**Scoring:**
- Small asteroid: 75 pts
- Medium asteroid: 50 pts
- Large asteroid: 25 pts

After each level, asteroids get faster and more numerous. The environment color shifts every level — 8 distinct zones that cycle.

## Power-Ups

Power-ups drop from destroyed asteroids. The better your streak, the more they appear.

| Power-Up | Effect | Duration |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 2x Gun | Triple shot, narrow spread | ~10 sec |
| 3x Gun | Triple shot, wide spread | ~7.5 sec |
| Rapid Fire | ~2.5x fire rate | ~8 sec |
| Side Guns | Extra bullets from ship flanks | Until death |
| Shield | Absorbs one hit | Until hit |
| Hyperspace | Gain 3 teleport charges (max 5) | Until used |

Timed power-ups flash when about to expire. All power-ups are lost when you die.
