[13:46:17] USER: PLease create the below file structure in the working directory. |   /assets |     /img |       /sprites |         /ship |         /asteroids |         /bullets |         /vfx |         /ui |       /backgrounds |       /overlays |       /branding |     /audio |       /sfx |       /music |       /ui |     /fonts |     /data |   /src |     game.js |     audio.js |     assets.js |     vfx.js |     ui.js
[13:46:28] ASSISTANT: Done! Here's the structure I created: |  | ``` | /assets |   /img |     /sprites |       /ship |       /asteroids |       /bullets |       /vfx |       /ui |     /backgrounds |     /overlays |     /branding |   /audio |     /sfx |     /music |     /ui |   /fonts |   /data | /src |   game.js |   audio.js |   assets.js |   vfx.js |   ui.js | ``` |  | All directories are created and the JS files have placeholder comments. Ready for your asteroids game! 🚀
[13:47:37] USER: i want to copy the contents of this asteroids directory to a repo of the same name on my github. Can you do that? I need to set up the repo first.
[13:48:12] ASSISTANT: Go ahead and create an empty repo called `asteroids` on GitHub (don't add a README, .gitignore, or license - keep it completely empty). |  | Once you've done that, let me know and I'll: | 1. Initialize a fresh git repo in your asteroids folder | 2. Add all the files | 3. Push everything to your new GitHub repo |  | Just reply when the repo is created! 🚀
[13:49:04] USER: OK, done, it's here: https://github.com/cd-source/asteroids
