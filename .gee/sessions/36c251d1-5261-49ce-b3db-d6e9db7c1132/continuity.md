# Continuity Ledger

This ledger maintains state across context compaction. Auto-updated by Gee.

## Session
**Started:** (auto-filled on session start)
**Goal:** <!-- Current objective - what are we trying to accomplish? -->

## Recent Work
- [00:00] Created complete file structure for asteroids game project with /assets (img, audio, fonts, data) and /src directories with placeholder JS files
- [00:01] User preparing to push asteroids project to GitHub - awaiting empty repo creation
- [00:02] Successfully initialized git and pushed asteroids project to GitHub (https://github.com/cd-source/asteroids)
- [00:03] Reformatted asteroid_assets.md with proper markdown structure: ## headers for categories, - list items, and dimensions in parentheses
- [00:04] Rewrote asset_spec.md for game-asset-mvp tool compatibility: shortened filenames, removed audio/FX, standardized parser format with ### headers and detailed specs
- [00:05] User flagged formatting issues in asset_spec.md - corrected to use ## headers for categories, - for list items, and (dimensions) format per game-asset-mvp tool requirements
- [00:06] User requested copying local assets folder contents to Git repo asteroids project - clarified what needs to be copied (existing ./assets structure vs. external assets)
## Active Context
**Current focus:** Clarifying asset file organization and transfer to Git repository

**Files being modified:**
- ./assets/ structure - awaiting clarification on what to copy

**Blockers/Issues:**
- Ambiguity on asset source location and copy destination - awaiting user clarification
## Key Decisions

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementing core game mechanics (player ship, movement, rotation)
2. Add asteroid spawning and collision detection
3. Implement shooting mechanics
4. Add visual effects
5. Polish UI and game state management
